# Virtual Library Infrastructure Module

This module constitutes the Infrastructure layer of the virtual library backend project. It encompasses all the technical details that sit below the level of abstraction captured by the Core and Use Cases modules. The Infrastructure is responsible for interacting with external systems and frameworks, such as database systems, file systems, and web frameworks.

It also implements the persistence layer, by defining models and repositories that correspond to entities and interfaces defined in the Core, thus allowing for the actual storage and retrieval of data.

Additionally, this module contains an authentication service that interfaces with security mechanisms to authenticate users, and the application-specific settings that can be read from configuration files or environment variables.

The Infrastructure layer is designed to be as external and as plug-and-play as possible, so that the higher layers of the application can remain unaffected by changes at this level.

## Components

- Persistence
  - Models: Definitions that map entities to database tables.
  - Repositories: Implementations of the repository interfaces from the Core module.

- Security
  - AuthenticationService: Implementation that handles user authentication details, including password hashing, token generation, and verification.

- Config
  - Settings: Centralized configuration management to interface with external configuration files or environment variables.

- Database
  - Database connection and management-related functionality to initialize and maintain database sessions.

The Infrastructure module ensures that the Core and Use Case modules remain independent of any particular technological or framework-specific details. This is in keeping with the clean architecture principles, promoting a maintainable, scalable, and adaptable codebase.
