# Virtual Library Presentation Module

This module represents the outermost layer of the application where the application's interface with the outside world is defined. It usually includes things like UI, REST APIs, and other such interfaces that external agents can interact with.

## Overview

This module is responsible for handling all kinds of presentation logic which includes defining HTTP route handlers, serialization, and deserialization of data, validation and error handling, also managing the API responses and formatting. It bridges the communication between client requests and the application's core logic.

## Core Responsibilities

- Defining the RESTful endpoints using FastAPI libarary.
- Dependency injection components for obtaining instances of use cases.
- Formatting and handling API responses and status codes.
- Serializing inputs from HTTP requests and passing them to appropriate use cases.
- Deserializing outputs from use cases into HTTP response models.
- Error handling and returning proper error responses.

## Structure

The Presentation module typically contains the following files:
- `main.py`: The entry point of the application and where the FastAPI app instance is defined along with routes.
- `dependencies.py`: Containing dependency injection utilities and configurations.
- `api_responses.py`: Standard API response schemas and formatting utilities.
- `utils.py`: Helper functions that support various presentation tasks.

## Usage

To integrate changes into this module, developers are expected to have an understanding of FastAPI or similar frameworks for creating RESTful services. Changes made here should not require understanding or alterations to business logic as they should be confined to presentation concerns only.
